                    <p>During the Leeds Festival in 2013, Sykes revealed that he had a history of drug abuse and addiction.</p>
                    <p>Sykes has stated that he is an atheist: "I don't believe in God. I was asked to believe in him when I was in such a bad place. </p>
                    <p>I couldn't understand why I needed a god or, in my opinion, something that doesn't exist."</p>
                    <p>In 2015, he founded the charity organization "Drop 4 Drop," which works to provide access </p>

                    <p>He has been married twice, first in 2015 to a model and tattoo artist, but they divorced in May 2016.</p>
                    <p>His second wedding was in July 2017, to Alissa Salls, a Brazilian model and his current partner.</p>
                    <p>In addition to his music career, Sykes has been involved in various creative projects. He is the owner of the clothing brand</p>
                    <p>Drop Dead Clothing, which he founded in 2005. He has also collaborated with other fashion brands and has designed several pieces</p>
